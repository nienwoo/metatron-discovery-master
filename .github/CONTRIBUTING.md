## Pull Requests
Metatron project only accepts pull requests related to open issues.

So, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/metatron-app/metatron-discovery/issues) with the owners of this repository before making a change. 
After sufficient discussion, send us your pull requests! 

**CAUTION!** We are operating release branch. Not allow merging into master branch.
So, your pull request's base is must set to our planned release branch.
We will give you information during pre-discussion.

It is frequently necessary to synchronize your branch with other changes that have landed in base(release) branch by using git rebase.
```
git fetch --all
git rebase origin/${base branch}


# The git push --force-with-lease command is one of the few ways to delete history in git. 
# Before you use it, make sure you understand the risks and discuss with your co-workers.

git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch
```
